# Midterm Lab Task 3: Creating Pivot Tables and Charts
For this task we are creating pivot tables and charts using the previous data from midterm lab task 2.

# Step 1: Prepare and Organize Data
- Open the previous data from Midterm Task 2 into data -> new query -> CSV.
- Create a new column named "Job Title per Sector".
- Ensure the dataset includes columns like Role Type, Size, state, uncleaned data, and Job Title per Sector.
- after that click "close and load to".

# Step 2: Create Pivot Tables, Charts and apply Slicers
- Create another sheet in excel and name it as "analysis" then Insert -> Pivot Table then drag the "Role Type" to make it as pivot table
- In the right side mark check the data that you want to see (e.g. Role Type, Sal Min, Sal Max)
- Insert -> Recommended Chart
- Select the role type ->  Insert -> Slicer -> check only the role type
- Repeat the process but this time "State and to Size" and in size you choose only the top 5

# Step 3: Creating DashBoard
- From analysis you create another sheet and name it as "dashboard"
- Page Layout -> Size -> Letter-> [Orientation -> landscape (optional)]
- Follow the limit of line in the center when you are merging
- Copy the output of your analysis then paste it on dashboard
- Design it by your choice
